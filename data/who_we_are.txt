Who We Are

Project West Campus is run entirely by UT Austin students who care deeply about the West Campus community.
We are not a nonprofit or official UT organization.
We operate as an independent, volunteer-driven community service group focused on feeding neighbors experiencing homelessness.

Team roles may include:
- Volunteer coordinators
- Food prep and distribution leads
- Safety and logistics helpers
- Outreach and communication members
