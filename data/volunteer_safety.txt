Safety priorities for volunteers:
- Always volunteer in a group (minimum 2–3 people)
- Stay aware of surroundings
- Avoid entering tents or private property
- Do not touch personal items or belongings
- Offer items calmly and respectfully
- If someone declines food, thank them and continue the route
- If someone appears in crisis, do not intervene directly

Emergency protocol:
- Call 911 for emergencies
- For non-emergency concerns, contact UTPD
