What We Do

Project West Campus focuses on:
- Preparing and distributing food to unhoused neighbors
- Organizing student volunteers for donation drives
- Building weekly routes for food handouts
- Coordinating pickup and delivery of supplies
- Providing students with safe, respectful volunteer guidance

We do not offer medical, legal, housing, or emergency services.
We strictly provide food support and essential items.
